## Dataset Compression

MDIO relies on [numcodecs] for data compression. We provide good defaults based
on opinionated and limited heuristics for each compressor for various energy datasets.
However, using these data models, the compression can be customized.

[Numcodecs] is a project that a convenient interface to different compression
libraries. We selected the [Blosc] and [ZFP] compressors for lossless and lossy
compression of energy data.

## Blosc

A high-performance compressor optimized for binary data, combining fast compression
with a byte-shuffle filter for enhanced efficiency, particularly effective with
numerical arrays in multi-threaded environments.

For more details about compression modes, see [Blosc Documentation].

## ZFP

ZFP is a compression algorithm tailored for floating-point and integer arrays, offering
lossy and lossless compression with customizable precision, well-suited for large
scientific datasets with a focus on balancing data fidelity and compression ratio.

For more details about compression modes, see [ZFP Documentation].
