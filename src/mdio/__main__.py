    """CLI generator via plugin design pattern.

    This class will generate the CLI submodules based on what is included
    in the `commands` folder in `mdio` module. The CLI components are
    implemented under `commands`, and this class will parse them and serve
    them as user requests it.

    Serving happens by evaluating the Python function using `eval`.

    The original implementation in the `click` reference using `eval` is
    dangerous because it allows arbitrary code execution. However, we fix
    that by providing a global namespace to `eval` with ONLY allowed modules
    and by explicitly NOT allowing any python builtin functions (like import),
    and also by providing an empty local namespace to be filled with CLI
    functions. Check the `get_command` method for implementation.

    References:
        Original implementation:
        https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/commands/#custom-multi-commands
