    This tool takes an original chunking scheme, the full shape of the
    original array, a target size (in bytes) and length of the `array` or
    `struct` to calculate a multidimensional scalar for smaller arrays.

    Use case is: Seismic data has 1 extra time/depth dimension, which doesn't
    exist in headers or spatial live mask. So we can make chunk size bigger
    for these flatter arrays.

    This module infers a scalar based on the parameters and returns a new
    chunking scheme.

    Args:
        orig_chunks: Original array chunks.
        orig_shape: Original array shape.
        target_size: Uncompressed, expected size of each chunk. This is much
            larger than the ideal 1MB because on metadata, after compression,
            the size goes down by 10x. Default: 32 MB.
        length: Length of the multidimensional array's dtype.
            Default is 240-bytes.

    Returns:
            Tuple of adjusted chunk sizes.
